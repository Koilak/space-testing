# Standard Alert Levels
## Green
Attention! Station alert level is now green! It is now safe to return to your workplaces.

The default alert level. This usually means there is no existing threat to the station or that a previous threat has been dealt with. Security forces and command are not permitted to open (visibly) carry any lethal weapons as they patrol and perform most of their duties. This even includes potential default loadout options such as the HOS energy shotgun. Every search or arrest made needs evidence and approval (a warrant) of a prosecutor or higher when they are present.

## Blue
Attention! Station alert level is now blue! There is a confirmed threat to the station. Security should perform random checks. Crewmembers are advised to be vigilant and report suspicious activity to security.


There is a confirmed threat on the station, but it is not considered existential or overly dangerous. This is usually the cue for people to get out of the bar and go do their jobs. On a blue alert, Security may conduct random searches on anyone at any time. Arrests may be made,  however the crew always has right to an attorney and due trial if legal is present. Command and security are still confined to carrying small and light firearms but may openly carry lethal weaponry.



## Red
Attention! Station alert level is now Red! There is an immediate threat to the station. Security should prepare to use lethal force if necessary. Crewmembers should find a safe place to shelter in, and are advised to follow any present authorities.


There is a known threat that poses a threat to all crew. Non-combatant crew are advised to avoid uninhabited areas such as maintenance and stick together. Red alert is extremely variable, and may denote anything from high levels of Syndicate activity to Nuclear Operatives, a Space Ninja and a Dragon all at once. Generally, Security will arm up with powerful weapons from the Armory, but that is not always necessary or even possible in some circumstances. Generally, medical will be set to emergency access, allowing any person to treat themselves if they know how.

# Non-Standard Alert Levels
## Yellow
Attention! Station alert level is now Yellow! There is a structural or atmospheric threat within the station. Engineering staff are advised to immediately respond and perform safety measures. Crewmembers are advised to stay away from the threat, and stay in their workplaces if necessary.


A yellow alert may denote a wide range of threats to the station. The most basic are cases where a large section of the station is uninhabitable due to space exposure or extreme temperatures. In these cases, people usually just yell at the Engineers until it is fixed.

Alternatively, this denotes the presence of a Tesla Ball or a Singularity loose on the station, affectionately referred to as a Tesloose or a Singuloose respectively. In these cases, people generally tend to yell at the Engineers anyway. These are EXTREMELY dangerous, the only solution in 99.9% of cases being to run away. You practically must get an EVA suit or Emergency EVA suit if possible, either from EVA, or the blue O2 closets dotted around the station.

The Singularity is generally considered (slightly) less dangerous. It is a black hole that will devour the entire station if left long enough. It will not necessarily chase people, and it can be seen from a distance due to its reality-warping effect. However, if you can actually see it yourself, you are probably dead if you are not the Chief Engineer due to the extreme doses of radiation.

The Tesla Ball creates violent electric shocks and explosions as it travels. Having insulated gloves will protect you from the shocks, but they will not save you from the explosions or the ball itself (which will remove you from reality if it touches you). The Tesla targets powered devices and living creatures. This means that the best chance of survival is to turn off your PDA flashlight, and break the APCs around you if possible.

## Violet
Attention! Station alert level is now Violet! There is a viral threat on the station. Medical staff are advised to isolate crewmembers with any symptoms. Crewmembers are advised to distance themselves from others and perform safety measures to prevent further spread.


Since Virology does not currently exist, the only reason this alert may be called is due to Zombies. Contrary to most other alert levels, The medical department is often bolted down to avoid infection. If you've killed a zombie and are not infected, you should bring it to the Chemists in hope they can synthesize a cure. Generally, it is safest to be with members of Security or Command, as they have weaponry and/or can bolt down areas if needed. If you are somehow safe, try protecting the Chief Medical Officer and the Chemists in hopes they create a cure in time.

Special Alert Levels
These are alert levels that only Administrators or the game itself can trigger.

## Delta
Attention! Station alert level is now Delta! The station is currently under threat of imminent destruction. Crewmembers are advised to listen to heads of staff for more information.


Currently, this alert is automatically triggered by the start of the 5-minute countdown of the Nuclear Fission Explosive. This is implicitly caused by Nuclear Operatives during a normal shift, and comes with all that entails. To survive, some quick maths is required. If the emergency shuttle is due to leave before the countdown is finished, your best chance is to either get to Evac or to a nearby emergency pod. If that's not possible and Cargo is still functional, you can try to convince them to let you on their shuttle, which will likely make a narrow run from the station moments before detonation. If neither of these are possible, you should fight them head-on. If you are part of Security or an armed member of Command, you must, but if you are any other member of the crew it is simply heavily advised.

## Gamma
Attention! Station alert level is now Gamma! Central Command has ordered the Gamma security level on the station. Security is to have weapons equipped at all times, and all civilians are to immediately seek their nearest head for transportation to a secure location.


An admeme alert level. This is triggered with a command, and denotes one of two things. It could simply be a red alert with the caveat that an administrator will be creating the threats, or it could denote that ERT has been called to the station due to the awful state it is in.

## Epsilon
Attention! Station alert level is now Epsilon! Central Command has ordered the Epsilon security level on the station. Consider all contracts terminated.


An admeme alert level. Epsilon means one thing: the station fucked up. This could be in jest, but could similarly indicate that whoever is responsible is definitely getting banned for a long time after this. When Epsilon is called, an elite Death Squad is dispatched from Nanotrasen to clean up the mess. The Death Squad can have a variety of orders, but almost all of them are bad for you. These orders can range from killing the offending players to detonating the Nuclear Fission Explosive to be rid of this mess. The Death Squad is extremely lethal, your only solution in most cases is to RUN.
